# Explore MNIST

The shiny app is divided into 2 main pages: a **visualization page** and a **classification page**.

The goal of the **visualization page** is to embed the high dimensional space generated by the digits in the mnist dataset into a 3d space using  *t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding* and play with its hyper-parameters.

Inspired by [https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/), the shiny-app allow the user to modify the hyper-parameters and see how the low dimensional embedding space changes accordingly. For comparison  reason it is also shown the PCA projection of the images into the first 2 principal components.

The **classification page** allow the user to sketch a digit inside a black board and, after clicking *save*, the system compares the sketch with its nearest neighbors in the mnist dataset. 

*Note*: flattening the image into a vector is not a powerful technique because it throws away all spatial informations, this cause a very high generalization error.

To speed-up the computation, the euclidean distance between the drew image and the dataset is computed using an Rcpp function.
